# A Blog Starter App

This is a Minecraft blog app, started with Vite.

It was made using Firebase and React to reference how Minecraft travelers living in the world use signs to display messages to others.

It works entirely within my firebase database so everything added will be stored and accessible. It also uses firebase user authentication to keep track of logged in users.

Nonetheless i will continue to add features to this, making it have newer features for all weary travelers.

This was made by Garnik Gevorkyan.

The link to where it is deployed is https://starter-project-90491.web.app
